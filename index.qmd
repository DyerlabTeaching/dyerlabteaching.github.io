> This github account houses all of the repositories I have created for teaching resources.  Where possible, I have attempted to break apart the components of my instruction into the least common denominators.  These can individually serve as building-blocks of instruction for a wide range of coureses as well as sources of quick instruction for individuals needing to relearn specific components.
